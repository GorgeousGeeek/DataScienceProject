How might we use data science to predict potential credit card customer attrition, so that we can provide better loyalty outreach to retain them?

Introduction
“Customer attrition is a widespread problem that affects firms in a variety of industries. For
example, US credit card providers often deal with annual churn rates of about 20 percent,
and mobile phone carriers in Europe battle 20 to 38 percent churn, according to the paper.
Lost customers lead to untapped dollars. A McKinsey report estimated that reducing churn
could increase earnings of a typical US wireless carrier by as much as 9.9 percent. It's no
surprise then that executives in both the United States and Europe say customer retention is
their highest marketing priority—and they've been given bigger budgets to fight the battle.”

Background
Mr Chow, a manager at DSBank, is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their
credit card services. They would really appreciate, if one could predict for them who is going
to get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services
and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

Objectives
- Through data exploration, understand the pattern or find correlations in the data that
would lead to customers leaving.
- Producing a model that is able to predict if a credit card customer would leave.
- In choosing a model, the potential loss of income from wrongly predicting an attrition
customer (or False Negative) would cost us more than wrongly predicting a staying
customer (or False Positive). However, as we continue to strive for more cost
savings, we hope to keep a close balance between the two.

Data Gathering
- A subset of data has been extracted from the customer database that also describes
if a customer has attrited.
- As we dive deeper into data modeling, training and validation, we may uncover the
need for more semi-structured data, such as customer feedback, which is currently
unavailable due to being siloed in a different department. Also, feedback from online
social networking sources such as the bank’s Facebook or Twitter page, cannot be
easily linked to existing customer profiles.
